# Custom-format-FBX-SDK
Custom format using the FBX SDK

We created a custom format for a game engine, using the FBX SDK as a reference. 

FBX files are opened with the FBX SDK, and relevant information is converted to our custom format. 
When the information is converted, it is then printed to a binary file. 

The custom format includes the following:
1. Mesh data such as vertices
2. Lambert and Phong materials
3. Diffuse and Normal/Bump textures
4. Cameras
5. Lights
6. Morph animations (Not tested)

OBSERVE!!
I could not push the code to github, since the lib files for the FBX SDK were to big, and I havent had the time to fix it..
If you want the code, please contact me instead.
